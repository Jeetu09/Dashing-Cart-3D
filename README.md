🎮 Dashing Cart 3D

Dashing Cart 3D is a physics-based demo game developed using the Unity 3D Engine (Version 6000).
This project demonstrates my understanding of game mechanics, player control, and collision handling using modern Unity tools.

🕹️ Gameplay
-The player controls a cart and must dodge obstacles (walls).
-The goal is to reach the finish line without colliding.
-Collision with any wall ends the game.

🛠️ Core Features & Technologies
-Unity New Input System – modern, event-based player input
-Rigidbody Physics (AddForce) – smooth, physics-driven movement
-OnCollisionEnter – real-time collision detection
-TextMeshPro – high-quality UI text rendering
-Cursor Lock System – improved gameplay focus and control

🎯 What This Project Demonstrates
-Strong understanding of Unity physics and player movement
-Experience with latest Unity Input System
-Clean implementation of game-over logic
-Ability to build a complete, playable game loop
